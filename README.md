Shortest Path Finder
I'm excited to share my latest project, the Shortest Path Finder, built with Python! ðŸš€
If You Run This Project And get the Preview! here is Repl Link: https://replit.com/@Pythonworlds/Shortest-Path-Finder?v=1

Description:
The Shortest Path Finder is a Python application designed to calculate the shortest path between two points in a graph. 
tilizing algorithms like Dijkstra's and A*, 
this tool is perfect for understanding how these algorithms work in real-world applications such as GPS navigation, network routing, and game development.

Features:
User-friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface to input your graph data and visualize the shortest path.
Multiple Algorithms: Supports Dijkstra's Algorithm and A* Algorithm.
Real-time Results: Quickly computes and displays the shortest path.
Customization: Allows customization of graph nodes and edges to suit various scenarios.

How It Works:
Input Graph Data: Enter the nodes and edges of your graph.
Select Algorithm: Choose between Dijkstra's or A* Algorithm.
Compute Path: The application computes and displays the shortest path.

Applications:
GPS Navigation: Find the quickest route between locations.
Network Routing: Optimize data packet transfer routes.
Game Development: Implement pathfinding in games.

Technology Stack:
Language: Python
Libraries: curses, wrapper, queue, time
